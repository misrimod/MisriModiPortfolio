                Recently participated in a designathon with my professional fraternity, Alpha Theta Delta. 
                The prompt was to improve efficiency in an e-commerce warehouse. Our team initially struggled 
                to balance the needs of diverse roles, such as pickers, managers, and inventory trackers, without 
                compromising usability. I proposed dividing the problem into sections based on roles and 
                brainstorming tailored solutions for each. After many discussions to ensure every perspective 
                was considered, we created a system with distinct interfaces and designs for each role, optimizing 
                workflows while maintaining a cohesive design language. This experience emphasized the importance 
                of collaboration and flexibility in problem-solving.

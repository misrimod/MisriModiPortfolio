              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                I am a passionate designer and developer pursuing a UX/UI degree at the University of Michigan. 
                With a strong foundation in front-end development and a flair for crafting thoughtful digital experiences, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and creating user-centered solutions. 
                As a member of Alpha Theta Delta, a professional design fraternity, I am constantly honing my design skills and exploring new tools and techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond digital design, I channel my creativity in various leadership and artistic roles. 
                As the SAPAC Events Committee Head, I organize and promote impactful events focused on raising awareness and fostering dialogue around important social issues. 
                Additionally, I serve as the set designer for Wolveraas, a traditional Indian dance team specializing in raas and garba. 
                In this role, I merge artistry and engineering to conceptualize and construct large-scale, dynamic props that complement the vibrant choreography and cultural storytelling of our performances.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, you’ll find me immersed in a good book, experimenting with crafts, or seeking inspiration through creative projects. 
                I’m always eager to explore new ideas and bring them to life through design.

            Project 1: Designing for Ethical and Humane Warehouses
          </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Recently participated in a designathon with my professional fraternity, Alpha Theta Delta. 
          The prompt was to improve efficiency in an e-commerce warehouse. Our team initially struggled 
          to balance the needs of diverse roles, such as pickers, managers, and inventory trackers, without 
          compromising usability. I proposed dividing the problem into sections based on roles and 
          brainstorming tailored solutions for each. After many discussions to ensure every perspective 
          was considered, we created a system with distinct interfaces and designs for each role, optimizing 
          workflows while maintaining a cohesive design language. This experience emphasized the importance 
          of collaboration and flexibility in problem-solving.

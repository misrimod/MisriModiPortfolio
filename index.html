              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                I am a passionate designer and developer pursuing a UX/UI degree at the University of Michigan. 
                With a strong foundation in front-end development and a flair for crafting thoughtful digital experiences, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and creating user-centered solutions. 
                As a member of Alpha Theta Delta, a professional design fraternity, I am constantly honing my design skills and exploring new tools and techniques.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond digital design, I channel my creativity in various leadership and artistic roles. 
                As the SAPAC Events Committee Head, I organize and promote impactful events focused on raising awareness and fostering dialogue around important social issues. 
                Additionally, I serve as the set designer for Wolveraas, a traditional Indian dance team specializing in raas and garba. 
                In this role, I merge artistry and engineering to conceptualize and construct large-scale, dynamic props that complement the vibrant choreography and cultural storytelling of our performances.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, you’ll find me immersed in a good book, experimenting with crafts, or seeking inspiration through creative projects. 
                I’m always eager to explore new ideas and bring them to life through design.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                As a designer and developer, I am skilled in industry-standard tools and proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to create functional, visually compelling, and accessible digital experiences. Accessibility is central to my work—I design and code solutions that are intuitive and inclusive for all users.

                My perspective is uniquely shaped by my role as a set designer for Wolveraas, a raas/garba dance team, where I craft large-scale, dynamic sets that blend storytelling, cultural expression, and practical functionality. Balancing artistic vision with physical constraints has honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of design as a tool for connection and impact.

                As a member of the professional design fraternity Alpha Theta Delta (ATD), I collaborate with other creatives on branding and digital design projects. This experience has strengthened my communication skills and taught me to balance teamwork and individuality.

                Whether designing physical sets or digital interfaces, I strive to create work that tells meaningful stories and connects with audiences while prioritizing usability and inclusivity.

        <p>
            I recently participated in a designathon with my professional fraternity, Alpha Theta Delta. 
            The prompt was to improve efficiency in an e-commerce warehouse. Our team initially struggled 
            to balance the needs of diverse roles, such as pickers, managers, and inventory trackers, without 
            compromising usability. <a href="project1.html" class="read-more">Read more</a>
